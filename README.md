## Deploy a Kubernetes Cluster with Terraform
These Terraform configurations automate the provisioning of Kubernetes clusters on AWS (EKS), GCP (GKE), or Azure (AKS). With a few variable inputs, you can launch a fully managed Kubernetes cluster on the cloud provider of your choice.

### Get Started
- Install [terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
- Pick your cloud provider: AWS, GCP, or Azure
- Navigate to the corresponding directory
- Follow the instructions in the corresponding README
- Monitor the Terraform output and wait for your cluster to deploy

That's it. Next up, [deploy Sourcegraph](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/deploy/kubernetes).
