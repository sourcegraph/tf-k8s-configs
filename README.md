## Deploy a Kubernetes Cluster with Terraform
These Terraform configurations deploy Kubernetes clusters on AWS (EKS), GCP (GKE), and Azure (AKS) with ease. Just specify a few variables and watch your cluster come to life!

### Get Started
- Install [terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
- Pick your cloud provider: AWS, GCP, or Azure
- Navigate to the corresponding directory
- Follow the instructions in the corresponding README
- Monitor the Terraform output and wait for your cluster to be ready!

That's it. Enjoy and happy Terraforming.
