## Deploy a Kubernetes Cluster with Terraform
This repository provides examples of provisioning Kubernetes clusters on major cloud providers using Terraform. These should be treated as illustrative examples, not production-ready infrastructure configuration.

### Get Started
- Install [terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
- `cd` into the directory corresponding to your cloud provider (aws, gcp, or azure) and follow the instructions in the README in that directory.
- Monitor the Terraform output and wait for your cluster to deploy

Next, [deploy Sourcegraph](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/deploy/kubernetes).
